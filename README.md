# server-scripts
scripts for setting up new raspberry pi nodes in my cluster

`firstrun.sh`: requires values to be set before running the script, this allows the script to be executed completely headlessly.

`firstrun-userinput`: allows values to be set during the running of the script, needs keyboard/mouse access beforehand.
